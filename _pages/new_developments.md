<strong>Bugfixes</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Removed TROPOMI albedo filters after consultation with SRON.</li>
    <li>Fixed various errors including those in TROPOMI variables, observation array size, and Harvard GEOS Chem environment files.</li>
</ul>

<strong>New Features</strong>
 <ul>
    <li>Introduced a new default boundary conditions version (v2023-06) with significant updates, including the removal of a misapplied stratospheric correction and albedo filters.</li>
    <li>Added support for specifying partitions for sbatch commands to enhance ease of use on local clusters.</li>
</ul>

<strong>General Improvements</strong>
<ul>
<li>Enabled nc4 compression, significantly reducing the file size of the output directory generated by the IMI.</li>

 IMI 2.0 is slated to be released soon and will offer significant improvements over 1.x.

<ul style = "font-size: 0.9em">
            <li><strong>Blended Dataset Compatibility</strong>: IMI 2.0 is now compatible with a blended TROPOMI+GOSAT dataset, which helps to mitigate data artifacts and improve the accuracy of methane observations.</li>
            <li><strong>Incorporation of Point Source Observations</strong>: IMI 2.0 integrates high-resolution point source observations, allowing for more precise identification and quantification of methane emissions from large point sources.</li>
            <li><strong>Improved Computational Efficiency</strong>: The construction of the Jacobian matrix, a key computational step, has been sped up by an order of magnitude, making the inversion process significantly faster.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Error Characterization</strong>: The use of super-observations improves error characterization by averaging multiple individual observations, thus reducing noise and enhancing the reliability of the inversion results.</li>
            <li><strong>Adaptive Spatial Resolution and Global Capability</strong>: IMI 2.0 features adaptive spatial resolution based on the information content of observations, and it now supports global inversions, including the capability to optimize emissions and atmospheric concentrations on a global scale.</li>
        </ul>

<h3>Looking Forward: Goals for IMI 3.0<span><img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/6.x/svgs/solid/arrow-trend-up.svg" style = "height: 25px; width: 25px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 10px;"></span></h3>
<ul style = "font-size: 0.9em">
    <li><strong>12-km inversion capability</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>New 12km capability in GEOS-Chem allows 12km emission resolution in the IMI (led by Melissa Sulprizio and Xiaolin Wang)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Integration of MethaneSAT data into the IMI</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Cross validation of MethaneAir inversions using the IMI (led by Jack Bruno)</li>
            <li>MethaneAir is the aircraft emulator of MethaneSAT (launched March 2024)</li>
            <li>Opportunity to develop MethaneSAT observation operator</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Incorporation of point sources into the inversion framework (led by James East)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Extend the IMI to CO<sub>2</sub> (IMI + CO<sub>2</sub> = ICI)</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>CO<sub>2</sub> inversion capability being led by Hannah Nesser</li>
            <li>NASA Earth Information System â€“ Greenhouse Gases (EIS-GHG) project led by Lesley Ott & Kevin Bowman (JPL)</li>
            <li>An ICI could serve as a platform for the EIS-GHG</li>
            <li>Current CO<sub>2</sub> sensing satellites (OCO-2/3) have sparse coverage well-suited for global inversions</li>
            <li>Future instruments (GOSAT-GW, CO2M) could enable regional CO<sub>2</sub> inversions</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
