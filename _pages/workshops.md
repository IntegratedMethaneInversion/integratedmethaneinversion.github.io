## IMI - Integral Earth Workshop

On November 4, 2024, the Harvard Atmospheric Chemistry Modeling Group and Salata Institute will host a virtual workshop for current and prospective IMI users.

The workshop will comprise a series of short presentations by the IMI
development team highlighting the toolâ€™s capabilities (11 to 12 ET) followed
by discussion and Q&A (12 to 13 ET). Presentations will cover the problem of
atmospheric methane, how inverse analysis of satellite data can help
address it, and the range of emission monitoring features available in the
IMI.

The workshop will also introduce the web-based <a href = "http://integralearth.github.io" target = "#"><strong>Integral Earth</strong></a> platform for accessing the IMI and its key features.
