## IMI - Integral Earth Workshop

On November 4, 2024, the Harvard Atmospheric Chemistry Modeling Group and Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability will host a virtual workshop for current and prospective IMI users.

The workshop will comprise a series of short presentations by the IMI
development team highlighting the toolâ€™s capabilities (11 to 12 ET) followed
by discussion and Q&A (12 to 13 ET). Presentations will cover the principles for quantifying methane emissions by analytical inversions of satellite observations, the implementation of these principles in the IMI, the range of IMI capabilities, and how to run the IMI.

The workshop will also introduce the web-based <a href = "http://integralearth.github.io" target = "#"><strong>Integral Earth</strong></a>, which will enable easy access to the IMI by non-expert users
