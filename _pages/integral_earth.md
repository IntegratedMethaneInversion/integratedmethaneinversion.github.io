<p>
    The IMI provides <span style = "color: #F7BB1A">invaluable methane emissions data</span> that has been used by researchers, students, and stakeholders. And this data will only get more useful with the <span style = "color: #F7BB1A"><a href = "/releases" style = "text-decoration: underline; color: inherit;">exciting release of IMI 2.0</a></span>. Despite this data’s usefulness, the IMI often requires substantial technical expertise and access to computational resources.
</p>
<p>
    <span style = "color: #F7BB1A">Integral Earth will provide an intuitive, user-friendly interface that simplifies the entire process</span>. Users will be able to easily select their regions of interest, define inversion parameters, and visualize results without needing to understand complex coding or data processing techniques.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
    This democratization of access will empower a wider range of stakeholders, including policymakers, researchers, and environmental organizations, to leverage high-resolution methane emission data for climate action.
    </strong>
