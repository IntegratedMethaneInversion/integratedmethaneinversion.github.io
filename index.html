<h2>What is the IMI?</h2>

<p>The Integrated Methane Inversion (IMI) is a community cloud-computing tool for estimating regional methane emissions by analytical inversion of satellite observations from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). It enables researchers and stakeholders to infer methane emissions at 0.25° × 0.3125° (≈ 25 × 25 km2) resolution from <a href = "https://registry.opendata.aws/sentinel5p/">TROPOMI satellite data resident on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud</a>, without requiring expert knowledge of inverse methods or cumbersome data download. The IMI uses the <a href = "https://imi.seas.harvard.edu/imi/geos-chem.org">GEOS-Chem 3-D chemical transport model</a> as forward model for the inversion.</p>

<h2>Access</h2>

<strong>The IMI is completely open-source with IMI v1.1 being freely accessible via the AWS Marketplace. IMI v2.0 is planned to be released soon with <a href = "/new_developments">major updates</a>.</strong>

<p>To get started with the IMI, see our documentation on the <a href = "https://imi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">IMI readthedocs site</a>, which gives more technical information on configuration variables, how to set up AWS instances, and output data types.</p>

<p style = "border: solid #3B72B4 4px; padding: 7px;">We encourage new users to email us at <a href = "mailto:integrated-methane-inversion@g.harvard.edu">integrated-methane-inversion@g.harvard.edu</a> with a description of your project. This helps us identify priorities for new features and updates. <br><br> <strong>User technical support can also be provided via this email.</strong> </p>

<h2>Collaboration</h2>
<p>The IMI is a contribution to the NASA Carbon Monitoring System and a collaboration between the Harvard Atmospheric Chemistry Modeling Group (ACMG) and the Netherlands Institute for Space Research (SRON). ACMG development of the IMI is supported in part by ExxonMobil Technology and Engineering Company.</p>
